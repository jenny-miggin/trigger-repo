# Trigger Repo

This is the repo that triggers builds on CircleCI again

You'll notice there is no code, nor do the CircleCI config files live here - nifty!

The CircleCI config files live here: [config-repo](https://github.com/jenny-miggin/config-repo)

The code that is checked out during the `checkout` command lives here: [checkout repo](https://github.com/jenny-miggin/checkout-repo).
